**Add Item:** To add an item, you enter values for the name, monetary value, and serial number and then click add item. To note, the name must be between 2-256 characters, the monetary value must be 0+, and the serial number must be in the format of A-XXX-XXX-XXX, where "A" is a letter and "X" is a letter or digit and cannot match any other serial numbers. 

**Edit Item:** To edit an item, click on one of the rows/items. Editing will function similarly to adding an item, where you enter the values and click edit. The item you currently have selected will be replaced.

**Remove Item:** To remove an item, click on one of the item rows and press the "Delete Item" button.  This will remove the selected item from the list.

**Delete All:** To delete everything from the list, click the delete all button. This will allow you to clear the list and restart. 

**Search:** If you would like to search for a certain item, click on "Search" then "Search for" and it will lead you to a screen where you can search for an item based on name or serial number. 

**Sort:** To sort, click on one of the column/table headers labeled "Name", "Monetary Value", and "Serial". This will allow you to sort rows in ascending/descending order based on name, value, or serial number alphanumerically.

**Save Inventory:** To save an inventory, click "file" then "save inventory". This will bring up a file explorer and allow you to choose a location and name for the file you'd like to save. After choosing the location and name, select the file type you would like to save it as between TSV, GSON, or HTML. Then click save.

**Open Inventory:** To load an inventory from a file, click the "file" button and select "Open Inventory". This will bring the file explorer back up again and allow you to choose a file you would like to load. Once you choose a file type, file, and click open, it will load the chosen file into the inventory. If the file doesn't load, that means that it's not in the correct format the program uses, or not the correct file type. It's recommended to only open files that were made within this program.
